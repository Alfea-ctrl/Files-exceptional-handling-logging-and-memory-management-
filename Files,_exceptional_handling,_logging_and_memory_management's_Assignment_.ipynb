        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "\n",
        "  In simple terms, compiled languages convert the whole program into machine code before running (like C or Java), while interpreted languages like Python run the code line-by-line during execution. Thatâ€™s why Python is more flexible, but sometimes slower.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " 2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Exception handling is how we deal with unexpected errors in Python without crashing the program. We use try, except, finally, etc., to write safe and reliable code.\n",
        "\n",
        " 3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "  The finally block is used when we want some code to run no matter what â€” whether there's an error or not. Itâ€™s great for cleanup, like closing files.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Logging is used to record what's happening in our program â€” especially useful for debugging. Instead of printing, logging gives us better control and helps in maintaining real-world projects.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  __del__ is a special method (destructor) that runs automatically when an object is deleted. We can use it to clean up or release resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans\n",
        "\n",
        "1. import module: We access with module.function().\n",
        "\n",
        "2. from module import function: We use just function() directly.\n",
        "we  mostly use from ... import when we need just one or two things.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  We can use multiple except blocks or group them\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  It automatically opens and closes the file â€” no need to manually call file.close(). Itâ€™s safer and cleaner.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Multithreading: Used for tasks like downloading multiple things at once (same memory).\n",
        "\n",
        "  Multiprocessing: Better for CPU-heavy tasks (separate memory).\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "\n",
        "a. It keeps a permanent record.\n",
        "\n",
        "b. We can control what to log (error/info/debug).\n",
        "\n",
        "c. Itâ€™s better than print for debugging big     programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Memory management means how Python handles memory automatically. It creates, uses, and deletes memory blocks as per the need. Python uses techniques like reference counting and garbage collection, so we usually donâ€™t worry about memory leaks.\n",
        "\n",
        " 12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  The steps are simple:\n",
        "\n",
        "a- try: risky code goes here\n",
        "\n",
        "b- except: what to do if error happens\n",
        "\n",
        "c-  else: runs only if no error happens\n",
        "\n",
        "d- finally: always runs\n",
        "  This structure gives full control to manage errors properly.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "  Memory management is important Because if memory isn't managed, programs can become slow, or crash. Even though Python does it automatically, we should write clean code to avoid memory waste.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "  They are the core of error handling:\n",
        "\n",
        "a-try: wraps code that might throw error\n",
        "\n",
        "b-except: handles that error so program doesnâ€™t  \n",
        "crash\n",
        " we use it often when working with user input or files.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "\n",
        "  It uses reference countingâ€”an object is deleted when no variable refers to it. Plus, Python has a garbage collector to clean up unused memory blocks, especially circular references.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?  \n",
        "\n",
        "  The else block runs only if no exception occurs. It's useful when I want to run code that should happen only when everything is fine inside try.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " 17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  The main levels are:\n",
        "\n",
        "  DEBUG: low-level info\n",
        "\n",
        "  INFO: general messages\n",
        "\n",
        "  WARNING: something unusual\n",
        "\n",
        "  ERROR: an error happened\n",
        "\n",
        "  CRITICAL: serious failure\n",
        "  These help organize logs clearly.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  os.fork() creates a new process by duplicating the current one (Linux only).\n",
        "\n",
        "  multiprocessing works on Windows and Linux, and is more flexible and beginner-friendly.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " If we donâ€™t close a file, it might cause memory leaks or the file may not save data properly. Thatâ€™s why we either use f.close() or the with statement (which closes it automatically).\n",

        "file.read() â†’ Reads the entire content at once.\n",
        "\n",
        "file.readline() â†’ Reads only one line.\n",

        "\n",
        "22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?  \n",
        "\n",

        " Some challenges are:\n",

        " Unused objects might not get deleted (especially in loops)\n",
        "\n",
        " Circular references\n",
        "\n",
        " Overuse of memory in large applications\n",

        "\n",
        "24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        " we use the raise keyword. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        " #raise ValueError(\"Invalid value entered\")\n",
        "\n",
        " This helps in stopping the code and showing meaningful errors.\n",

        "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "\n",
        " Multithreading helps us to run multiple tasks simultaneously, especially when I/O is involved (like downloading files, reading sensors). It improves speed and responsiveness of the program.\n",
